How to Contribute
=================


# Fork it
Fork this repo into your own Github

# Pull request
Make edits in your own repo and when finished, submit a pull request to the main repo on Architect's Github, no rules after the initial few should be added from the main Architect repo.

Pull requests should have an explanation of what rules you've added and why; include any relevant links for the rules (i.e. a blog post about why it's good practice).

# Review
When there is a pull request, **all** Front End Devs should review the new rules. Either [ship it](http://shipitsquirrel.github.io/), or start a discussion why you think it might not be good for the rules.
